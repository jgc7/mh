<h1> Welcome to Jared Cooey's MP3 Digital Audio</h1>

<p>This mp3 audio file was created for my eportfolio project. For this project, I used two free soundtracks from Bensound.com. Bensound.com is a great resource that allows you to use royalty free music for your project, as long as you mention their name on the project.  This allows me to use background music without violating copyright. </p> 
I used the following effects for my audio file: 

<p> Fade in and out: After 10 seconds, I faded the first audio track out so that my vocals could be heard. This helped ensure that the music and my vocals wouldn't be competing with each other. Towards the end of my vocals, I faded in the next track of music. </p>

<p> Added Silence: I added silence to the remainder of the first track so that there would not be music for the while I was speaking. This also helped for a smoother sounding transition. </p>

<p> Time Shift: This was needed to decide when the music would start and stop and where I wanted to place my vocals. </p>
