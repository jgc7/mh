<h1> Welcome to Ross Nicol's MP3: Digital Audio</h1>



<p> This mp3 audio file was created for my eportfolio project which I will be submitting this summer. For this project, I used two free soundtracks from Bensound.com. Bensound.com is a great resource that allows you to use royalty free music for your project.  This is very important as you do not want to use any illegal music for your work. </p> 
I used the following effects for my audio file: 

<p> Fade in and out: I faded the first 30 seconds and the last 30 seconds of the track. I found this to be a smooth and welcoming way to begin. </p>

<p> Amplify: I used the amplify feature on Audacity to help control the volume on the audio track.  The original MP3 audio was very loud so it was important to reduce the volume so my voiceover could be heard. </p>

<p> Added Silence: I added silence to the first and last 2 seconds of the audio to help with the transition. </p>

<p>Applied Noise Reduction:</p>
